##Course Project

This repository is hosting the R code for the assignment of the Coursera DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. 

The purpose of this project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that performs some data cleaning on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data from UCI ( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and generates the "tidy_data.txt" file.

##Files

1. The "CodeBook.md" file describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.
  
2. The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that does the following:
  - downloads the dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" from UCI
  - unzips data in the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your working directory 
  - generates a new file "tidy_data.txt" in your working directory.
  
##Execution

Download the "run_analysis.R" file in your working directory and load it with R/R Studio.
